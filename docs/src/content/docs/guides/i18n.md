Starlight Auto Sidebar relies on Starlight's built-in support for [internationalization](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) to provide multilingual support when customizing autogenerated sidebar groups with metadata files.

See the [Starlight internationalization documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) for more information on how to configure i18n in your Starlight website.

## Fallback content

Similar to Starlight, Starlight Auto Sidebar expects you to create equivalent [metadata files](/metadata/) for your directories in all your languages.
This allows Starlight and the Starlight Auto Sidebar plugin to provide automatic fallback content for directories with custom labels or badges that have not yet been translated.

Read more about fallback content in the Starlight [“Internationalization”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#fallback-content) guide.
